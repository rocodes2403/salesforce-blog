Tech used: 
1. Angular - A framework to develop and build the entire application.
2. Angular Material - A UI components library since it provides major UI components out of box with a scope to customise.
3. NodeJS for both 1 and 2.

Application is tested only on Chrome in Windows machine.



Pending things:
1. On the home page, content & heading of the blog can be trimmed and only the first few characters can be shown with an ellipsis and a "show more" link pointing to the blog details route can be added.
2. Loader and empty state can be made into reusable components.
3. Common css utilities can be created.
4. Filters can be added in toolbar component.
5. The UI validation for blog heading and text is pending.
6. Unit tests

Along with the above items few things are not handled because of time constraints.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
